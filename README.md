# CryptoZombies-How-to-Build-an-Oracle

Smart contracts and JavaScript files created from following CryptoZombie’s three part "How to Build an Oracle" course. 

The course covers fetching data from exchange API’s, using Truffle to deploy the smart contracts, and ways to ensure said oracle maintains a level of decentralisation.
